# Gettysburg Address

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

八十七年前，我们的父辈们在这块大陆上建立一起了一个新的国度，它从自由中孕育，并且致力于人人生而平等的主张。

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.

如今，我们正在进行一场伟大的内战，它考验着这个国家——亦或是任何有此信仰和主张的国家——能否长久坚守这个信念。

We are met on a great battle-field of that war. 

我们在这个伟大的战场相遇。

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.

有的人为了这个国家得以存续而付出了生命，我们也必须致力于这个事业的一部分，或许这将成为我们最后的安息之所。

It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

但对我们而言这是义不容辞的。

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate—we can not consecrate—we can not hallow—this ground.

但是，从更加广泛的意义来看，我们无法在此祭奠，我们无法在此奉献，我们无法使这片土地得以神圣化。

The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. 

那些在此拼搏的勇士们，无论是否为此奉献了生命，已经使(这片土地)神圣化了，而这一意义是我们乏弱的力量所不能增减的。

The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. 

这个世界不会注意到，也不会长久地记得我们在此说了什么，但是，它永远也不会忘记他们在此做过的事。

It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. 

虽然这份事业尚未完成，但那些为此奋斗过的烈士们已经使它进入了最后的成熟阶段，无疑，我们这些活着的人应当继续致力于这份事业。

It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

我们应当投身于这个留在我们面前的伟大事业，从那些为此投入所有热忱的逝者那里，我们将获得更多热忱；我们绝不会使那些为此献出生命的人白白牺牲；我们将使这个国家，在上帝的祝福下，从自由里获得新生；而那为民所有，为民所治，为民所享的政府，也绝不会从这片土地上消亡。
