## A Basket of intangibles
> But not recently. For much of the past decade,value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind "growth" stocks,their antithesis.Perhaps this is because,as the industrial age gives way to digital age,the intangible assets that increasingly matter are not easy to put a value on.The tangible world is easier.Factories,machines,land and office buildings count as capital assets on a firms'books,because they will generate profits for many years. It is a fairly straightforward business to come up with a value for them:It is what the firm paid.This value is gradually written off (depreciated) over time to reflect wear and tear and obsolescence.

> 但近10年来的大多数时间，"价值型"股票低于市场并且远低于他们的对立面"成长型"股票。也许是因为：随着工业时代让步于数字时代，逐渐增加的无形资产并不容易去评估，而实体资产则容易得多。工厂，机器，土地和办公大楼算为公司账面的主要资产，因为他们在未来很多年将继续创造利润。评估他们的价值则直接简单的多：就是公司为他们所花费消耗耗的。这些资产随着时间的损耗反映了淘汰与消亡。

>然而，彭斯说 这项调查可能有助于解释一些关于味觉方面无法解释的现象。他指出，先前的实验已经发现人们依然能够在他们鼻子不参与情况下区分那些只能依靠气味才能区别的食物。
