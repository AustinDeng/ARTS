## A Basket of intangibles
> But not recently. For much of the past decade,value stocks have lagged behind the general market and a long way behind "growth" stocks,their antithesis.Perhaps this is because,as the industrial age gives way to digital age,the intangible assets that increasingly matter are not easy to put a value on.The tangible world is easier.Factories,machines,land and office buildings count as capital assets on a firms'books,because they will generate profits for many years. It is a fairly straightforward business to come up with a value for them:It is what the firm paid.This value is gradually written off (depreciated) over time to reflect wear and tear and obsolescence.

> 但近10年来的大多数时间，"价值型"股票低于市场并且远低于他们的对立面"成长型"股票。也许是因为：随着工业时代让步于数字时代，逐渐增加的无形资产并不容易去评估，而实体资产则容易得多。工厂，机器，土地和办公大楼算为公司账面的主要资产，因为他们在未来很多年将继续创造利润。评估他们的价值则直接简单的多：就是公司为他们所花费消耗耗的。这些资产随着时间的损耗反映了淘汰与消亡。
